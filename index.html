        This project is about creating a personal website displaying my projects as a portfolio.
        It was realized as a CMS-system in Grails, where I (or possibly other users) can log in online and add
        new projects to be displayed in the portfolio page.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Full implementation of a rather complicated css-template (including JavaScript-Animations),
                adopted to be fully working inside grails</li>
            <li>The application is fully responsive (except for the backend (Project-Controller)</li>
            <li>Domain-Model with various fields including constraints</li>
            <li>Showing all the projects, which are inside the database</li>
            <li>6 example projects already provided via bootstrapping</li>
            <li>Projects can show a previously uploaded image (image-upload-functionality not yet programmed)</li>
            <li>Projects can be dynamically filtered (by four categories). Filtering happens via CSS-filter</li>

        <h2>Approach</h2>

        <p>
            First of all, I started by building the base mvc structure of the project by using in course material as template. I got a quite amount of errors in the beginning but managed to fix them.
            After the setup was done, I started creating the logic for the mathematical calculations and continued by integrating this into the view. Then it took me a big load of time to create a proper
            styling with css, so it looks decent. After this i started to implement result saving to the database including adding it to the view and creating styles for it. Last but not least,
            a button to clear the history was implemented.
