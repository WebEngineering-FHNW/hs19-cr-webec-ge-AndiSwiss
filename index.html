        <h1>Portfolio Homepage</h1>

        <p>This project is about creating a personal website displaying my projects as a portfolio.
            It was realized as a CMS-system in Grails, where I (or possibly other users) can log in online and add
            new projects to be displayed in the portfolio page.</p>

                    <h2>Features</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full implementation of a rather complicated css-template (including JavaScript-Animations),
                            adopted to be fully working inside grails
                        </li>
                        <li>The application is fully responsive, including most of the back-end (Project-Controller)</li>
                        <li>Domain-Model with various fields including constraints</li>
                        <li>Front-page shows all the projects, which are residing the database</li>
                        <li>Six example projects already provided via bootstrapping</li>
                        <li>Projects can show a previously uploaded image (image-upload-functionality not yet
                            programmed)
                        </li>
                        <li>Projects can be dynamically filtered (by four categories). Filtering happens via
                            CSS-filter and the defined categories in the project-database-entries
                        </li>
                        <li>Unit-tests, including tests for my custom method 'getCategory()' in the Project Domain Model
                            (run in the terminal with './grailsw test-app')
                        </li>
                        <li>Security implemented: BACK-END can only be reached, when admin/admin is logged in</li>
                        <li>Full navigation, including dynamically changing buttons for "LOGIN FOR BACK-END",
                            "BACK-END", "LOGOUT", depending on whether you are logged in or not and depending on which
                            page you currently are (navigation is also fully responsive)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        At first, the whole Grails-Application was very difficult to understand for me. There was just
                        too much 'magic' going on. But after a lot of trial and error, reviewing course notes and
                        the course slides and also doing various tutorials, which I found online and regularly
                        consulting Stack Overflow, I started to understand all the concepts of the grails and how
                        it works in detail better an better, including the concepts of MVP, domain and the way how
                        Groovy and GSPs work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It all took much more time than I initially thought, but it was worth the steep learning curve.
                        There are still many ideas I had for the application, which I could not yet implement. But
                        I'm already quite happy with what I could achieve.
