# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

#### Project Idea Short Description: 

This project is about creating a portfolio page for my personal website. It will be realized as a CMS-system in Grails, where I (or possibly other users) can log in online and add new projects to be displayed in the portfolio page.

#### Planned Core Functionality:

- Database, which will contain the objects "project"
- Initially, each project contains the two following elements
  - title
  - description
- Front-End: Shows the project (initially the title and description of each project in the database)
- Back-End: The owner of the CMS can log in and edit/add/delete projects

#### Possible Extensions (subject to change):

- Expand object "project" with:
  - Link (clickable)
  - Project picture (including picture-upload)
  - Other (maybe optional) fields
  - Multiple project pictures, with gallery functionality in the front-end
- Include services:
  - If the provided link is a GitHub-Link, automatically show the last commits. API: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/
  - Generate PDF-function:
    - Generates a PDF per project (or all projects). Evaluate best API from https://rapidapi.com/blog/top-pdf-apis-life-easier/ or other source
    - Including a generated QR-Code printed on the PDF containing the link back to this page, e.g. with the following API: http://goqr.me/api/
